## Credits

Shuttle was inspired by [SSHMenu](http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/), the GNOME applet for Linux.

I also looked to projects such as [MLBMenu](https://github.com/markolson/MLB-Menu) and [QuickSmileText](https://github.com/scturtle/QuickSmileText) for direction on building a Cocoa app for the status bar.
